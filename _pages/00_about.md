  <em>What is the role of time in machine learning, vision, and algorithms?</em> In light of a world obviously dynamical, non-stationary, non i.i.d., open-ended, this is a question that fascinates and drives my research.

  The next decade machine learning and vision will meet the sciences, where temporality is omnipresent. Building models that understand time and dynamics will pave the way towards algorithms that are more reliable, robust, and explainable, and importantly, that can extrapolate also.

  With my team, we explore the above questions in multiple fronts. From system dynamics of neural nets and symmetries to computational models of memory, dynamical systems and temporal causality, with applications from oncology, to biomedical, astronomy, climate science, and more.
